Swarm-Clang
===========

This version of Clang is based on
[Cilk-Clang](https://github.com/wsmoses/Cilk-Clang).
It supports the `_Swarm_spawn` keyword
for manually parallelized Swarm programs,
as well as several forms of program annotations
to control the parallelization of programs that retain purely
sequential semantics.
